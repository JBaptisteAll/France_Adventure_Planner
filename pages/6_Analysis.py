    """Explanation of the Data for This Analysis
To evaluate the reliability of weather forecasts across France, I collected meteorological 
data for 50 cities from a larger dataset of 250 locations. The data was recorded over 
a two-month period from December 5, 2024, to February 7, 2025, and was structured into 
5 separate files, each corresponding to a different forecast horizon:
- **Jour 1** â†’ Weather forecast for the next day
- **Jour 2** â†’ Weather forecast for two days ahead
- **Jour 3** â†’ Weather forecast for three days ahead
- **Jour 4** â†’ Weather forecast for four days ahead
- **Jour 5** â†’ Weather forecast for five days ahead

This segmentation allows for a detailed comparison of forecast accuracy over time, 
helping to identify which locations have the most reliable weather predictions in France.
