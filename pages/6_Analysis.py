    meteorological data for 50 cities from a larger dataset of 250 locations. The data 
    was recorded over a two-month period from December 5, 2024, to February 7, 2025, 
    and was structured into 5 separate files, each corresponding to a different forecast 
    horizon:
    - **Jour 1** ‚Üí Weather forecast for the next day
    - **Jour 2** ‚Üí Weather forecast for the second day ahead
    - **Jour 3** ‚Üí Weather forecast for the third day ahead
    - **Jour 4** ‚Üí Weather forecast for the fourth day ahead
    - **Jour 5** ‚Üí Weather forecast for the fifth day ahead
    
    This segmentation allows for a detailed comparison of forecast accuracy over time,
    helping to identify which locations have the most reliable weather predictions in 
    France.

    France Adventure Planner is more than just a weather-based trip planner. It is a fully
